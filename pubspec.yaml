  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/fonts/
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Montserrat
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 600
        - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-ExtraBold.ttf
          weight: 800
    - family: GTSectraFine
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/GTSectraFine-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
